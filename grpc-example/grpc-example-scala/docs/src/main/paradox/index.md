# Lagom gRPC Example (Scala)

[Lagom](https://www.lagomframework.com/) is an open source framework (built on [Akka](https://akka.io/) and [Play](https://www.playframework.com/)) for developing reactive microservice systems in Java or Scala.
[Akka gRPC](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-grpc/current/overview.html) and [Play gRPC](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/play-grpc/current/) are toolkits for building streaming gRPC servers and clients on top of Akka Streams and Play.

This Guide will show you how to use Akka gRPC as an alternate RPC library to communicate two microservices developed using Lagom.

## Downloading the example

The Lagom gRPC Example is in the [Lagom Samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/lagom/lagom-samples) that you can clone locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lagom/lagom-samples.git
cd grpc-example/grpc-example-scala
```

## Running the example

You can run it like any Lagom application.

```bash
sbt runAll
```

The `runAll` command starts Lagom in development mode. Once all the services are started you will see Lagom's start message:

```bash
...
[INFO] Service hello-impl listening for HTTP on 127.0.0.1:11000
[INFO] Service hello-proxy-impl listening for HTTP on 127.0.0.1:54328
[info] (Services started, press enter to stop and go back to the console...)
```

As soon as you see the message `[info] (Services started, press enter to stop and go back to the console...)` you
can proceed. On a separate terminal, try the application:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9000/proxy/rest-hello/Alice
Hi Alice!
$ curl http://localhost:9000/proxy/grpc-hello/Steve
Hi Steve! (gRPC)
```

## Application Structure

This application is built with two Lagom services (`hello` and `hello-proxy`) exposing the following endpoints:

```bash
GET /proxy/rest-hello/:id    # served by hello-proxy-service (HTTP-JSON)
GET /proxy/grpc-hello/:id    # served by hello-proxy-service (HTTP-JSON)
GET /api/hello/:id           # served by hello-service (HTTP-JSON)
```

And also

```bash
  /helloworld.GreetingsService/sayHello   # served by hello-service (gRPC)
```

We want to show how to use gRPC for service communication, so in this guide the services are
as simple as possible, with no other features. While the `hello-service` always returns hard-coded
values the `hello-proxy` always forwards the request downstream to `hello-service`.

So when you invoke:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9000/proxy/rest-hello/Alice
```

The following happens:

```bash
 curl  --(http)-->  service gateway  --(http)-->  hello-proxy-service  --(http)-->  hello-service
```

Alternatively:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9000/proxy/grpc-hello/Alice
```

The following happens

```bash
 curl  --(http)-->  service gateway  --(http)-->  hello-proxy-service  --(gRPC/http)-->  hello-service
```

## Testing the gRPC endpoints

The gRPC endpoints are not accessible via the Lagom Service Gateway so it's only possible to consume them from
another Lagom service or pointing a client directly to the `HTTP/2` port of the Lagom Service. Earlier we
saw that Lagom informs of the following bindings:

```bash
...
[INFO] Service hello-impl listening for HTTP on 127.0.0.1:11000
[INFO] Service hello-proxy-impl listening for HTTP on 127.0.0.1:54328
[info] (Services started, press enter to stop and go back to the console...)
```

You can test the gRPC endpoint using [gRPCurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl).
Note that for simplicity, this sample is disabling TLS, therefore it's possbile to call the `HTTP/2` endpoint without using https.

```bash
$   grpcurl --proto hello-impl/src/main/protobuf/helloworld.proto \
          -d '{"name": "Katherine" }' \
          -plaintext 127.0.0.1:11000   \
          helloworld.GreeterService.SayHello
 {
   "message": "Hi Katherine! (gRPC)"
 }
```

The command above:

1. Uses the gRPC description on `hello-impl/src/main/protobuf/helloworld.proto`
1. Connects to the `hello-impl` service at `127.0.0.1:11000` using plaintext over `http`.
1. Sends a gRPC call `helloworld.GreeterService.SayHello` with `{"name": "Katherine" }` payload.
